# zombie-survival
JS game about survival in zombie apocalypse

## ideas
* rogue like
* uses local storage
* health decreases in real time, even when game is closed
* health is regained by eating/drinking
* exploration
* zombies everywhere
* weapons have very limited uses (encourage emergency use only)
* encourage player to explore and find new safe havens instead of always returning to one
* goal is to survive as long as possible in real days
