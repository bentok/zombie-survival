## Game Overview

### Philosophy: General

This game aims to be primarily a survival and resource management game with a focus on exploration and periodic checkins. I wish to create a game with high replay value that encourages the gamer to come back often to check on their character, sometimes to manage resources and sometimes to explore. Inspiration for tone is the original Dead Rising's infinite mode.

Another aspect would be a companion app to make resource management easy.

## Common Questions

### What is the game?

This game is a survival game in which the player has one life and must survive as long as possible. The core loop involves exploring to find resources, gathering resources, and finding a safe place to survive. Exploring will involve avoiding zombies and undead enemies. Exploration will be encouraged by having better safe areas, previous safe areas becoming less safe, items/npcs that help the character (giving stat bonuses, perks). When the user is well stocked on resources, they will need to periodically log in to eat/drink to restore health, which they will also be able to do via a mobile app which will allow them to view and use inventory items and stats.

### Where does the game take place?

The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting after a zombie outbreak with various biomes (rural, suburban and urban). Exploration will grant acces to new biomes with new enemy times and new item and npcs.

### What do I control?

The playable character is a normal person who is trying to survive.

### How many characters do I control?

You control one character, although you will encounter and be able to save npcs. Saving them will allow them to return to your current safe area.
